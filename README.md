# Computational Intelligence for the Internet of Things

This project implements an intelligent routing system for the potential Oeiras Municipality's EcoPoints, which could be equipped with sensors to monitor recyclable material levels. The system is designed to optimize the garbage truck's route for collecting recyclables from up to 100 EcoPoints, ensuring efficient operations within a 20-minute decision window. Utilizing a distance matrix the program employs Genetic Algorithms (GA) to determine the shortest route that starts and ends at the Central location while visiting the specified EcoPoints. The output includes the optimized route and its total length. The system is capable of handling various input sizes, demonstrating effectiveness in both average and worst-case scenarios, including the situation where all EcoPoints are full. This solution enhances the efficiency of waste collection processes in the municipality, contributing to improved recycling efforts.
